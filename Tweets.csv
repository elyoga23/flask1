5,68E+17;negative;@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
5,68E+17;negative;@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
5,68E+17;negative;@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.

5,70E+17;negative;@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock.

5,70E+17;negative;@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
5,70E+17;negative;@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service

5,70E+17;positive;@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•
5,70E+17;neutral;@united no I don't, but I'm sure United have my info on its system.

5,70E+17;negative;@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
5,70E+17;negative;@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient

5,70E+17;negative;@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Thank you.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
5,70E+17;neutral;@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
5,70E+17;negative;@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ‚úåÔ∏èout.

5,70E+17;negative;@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
5,70E+17;negative;@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
5,70E+17;negative;@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
5,70E+17;negative;@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
5,70E+17;neutral;@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
5,70E+17;negative;@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
5,70E+17;negative;@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.

5,70E+17;neutral;@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey
5,70E+17;negative;@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?
5,70E+17;negative;@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
5,70E+17;negative;@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
5,70E+17;negative;@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you"
5,70E+17;negative;@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
5,70E+17;negative;@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
5,70E+17;negative;@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
5,70E+17;negative;.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
5,70E+17;neutral;@united please be good to me this weekend!
5,70E+17;negative;@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
5,70E+17;negative;@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
5,70E+17;neutral;@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
5,70E+17;negative;@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united yall should probably work on that.
5,70E+17;negative;@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
5,70E+17;negative;@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
5,70E+17;negative;@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
5,70E+17;negative;@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....

5,70E+17;negative;@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
5,70E+17;neutral;@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
5,70E+17;negative;@united not able to DM you my confirmation number

5,70E+17;negative;@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
5,70E+17;negative;@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
5,70E+17;negative;@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?
5,70E+17;negative;@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
5,70E+17;negative;@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
5,70E+17;neutral;.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
5,70E+17;positive;@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round
5,70E+17;neutral;@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?
5,70E+17;negative;@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
5,70E+17;negative;@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
5,70E+17;negative;@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc√©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
5,70E+17;negative;@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
5,70E+17;positive;@united thnx for the info
5,70E+17;negative;@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher

5,70E+17;negative;@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)
5,70E+17;negative;@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
5,70E+17;positive;@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
5,70E+17;negative;@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
5,70E+17;negative;@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
5,70E+17;neutral;@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
5,70E+17;negative;@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim
5,70E+17;negative;@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Okay thank you
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
5,70E+17;negative;"@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr"
5,70E+17;negative;@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
5,70E+17;positive;@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
5,70E+17;negative;@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
5,70E+17;negative;@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
5,70E+17;negative;@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
5,70E+17;negative;@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
5,70E+17;negative;@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
5,70E+17;negative;@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
5,70E+17;positive;@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
5,70E+17;negative;@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
5,70E+17;negative;@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
5,70E+17;negative;@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
5,70E+17;positive;@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
5,70E+17;positive;@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
5,70E+17;positive;@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!
5,70E+17;negative;@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
5,70E+17;neutral;@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
5,70E+17;negative;"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
5,70E+17;negative;@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
5,70E+17;negative;@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
5,70E+17;negative;@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
5,70E+17;negative;@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
5,70E+17;negative;@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
5,70E+17;negative;@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
5,70E+17;positive;@united you are one great airline ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,70E+17;negative;@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
5,70E+17;negative;@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
5,70E+17;negative;@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
5,70E+17;negative;@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
5,70E+17;negative;@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL
5,70E+17;neutral;@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
5,70E+17;negative;@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
5,70E+17;positive;‚Äú@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN‚Äù We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
5,70E+17;negative;@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
5,70E+17;negative;@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
5,70E+17;negative;@united plus what about food? And taxis?
5,70E+17;negative;@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
5,70E+17;negative;@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
5,70E+17;negative;@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united yes I do.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
5,70E+17;negative;@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
5,70E+17;negative;@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
5,70E+17;negative;"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
5,70E+17;positive;@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
5,70E+17;negative;@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Deep Vein thrombosis
5,70E+17;negative;@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!
5,70E+17;negative;@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
5,70E+17;negative;Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
5,70E+17;negative;"@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail"
5,70E+17;negative;@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.

5,70E+17;negative;@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
5,70E+17;negative;@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
5,70E+17;positive;@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)
5,70E+17;negative;@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
5,70E+17;positive;@united But thanks for asking
5,70E+17;negative;@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B"
5,70E+17;negative;@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly.
5,70E+17;positive;@united you too!

5,70E+17;neutral;@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
5,70E+17;negative;@united why would they make me share a room?
5,70E+17;negative;@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
5,70E+17;negative;@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
5,70E+17;negative;@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
5,70E+17;negative;@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
5,70E+17;neutral;@united i understand, thanks
5,70E+17;negative;@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.

5,70E+17;negative;"@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement"

5,70E+17;negative;@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?
5,70E+17;negative;@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
5,70E+17;negative;@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I hope so too
5,70E+17;negative;@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous."
5,70E+17;negative;@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
5,70E+17;neutral;@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
5,70E+17;negative;@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
5,70E+17;negative;@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
5,70E+17;negative;@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united where is my flight voucher?
5,70E+17;negative;@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
5,70E+17;negative;@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement."
5,70E+17;negative;@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
5,70E+17;negative;@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
5,70E+17;negative;@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
5,70E+17;negative;"@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich."
5,70E+17;negative;@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
5,70E+17;negative;@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
5,70E+17;negative;@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
5,70E+17;positive;@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! üôå #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY

5,70E+17;positive;@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
5,70E+17;negative;@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
5,70E+17;negative;@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
5,70E+17;negative;@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
5,70E+17;negative;@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
5,70E+17;negative;@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
5,70E+17;negative;@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
5,70E+17;negative;@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
5,70E+17;positive;@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)"
5,70E+17;negative;@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
5,70E+17;positive;@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
5,70E+17;negative;@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
5,70E+17;negative;@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
5,70E+17;negative;@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
5,70E+17;negative;@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff."
5,70E+17;negative;@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes
5,70E+17;positive;@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while..
5,70E+17;negative;@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control‚Äîthe price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
5,70E+17;negative;@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
5,70E+17;negative;@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
5,70E+17;negative;@united GRK13575M is the file reference
5,70E+17;negative;@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
5,70E+17;negative;@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
5,70E+17;negative;@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
5,70E+17;negative;@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat

5,70E+17;negative;@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
5,70E+17;negative;@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!

5,70E+17;negative;@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change

5,70E+17;negative;@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
5,70E+17;negative;@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!

5,70E+17;negative;@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
5,70E+17;neutral;@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
5,70E+17;negative;@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
5,70E+17;negative;@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
5,70E+17;positive;Thank you ‚Äú@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH‚Äù

5,70E+17;neutral;@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?
5,70E+17;positive;@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
5,70E+17;negative;"@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb"
5,70E+17;negative;@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
5,70E+17;negative;"@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos."
5,70E+17;negative;@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
5,70E+17;positive;@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
5,70E+17;positive;@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
5,70E+17;positive;@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom
5,70E+17;negative;@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
5,70E+17;negative;@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
5,70E+17;negative;@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
5,70E+17;negative;@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out.
5,70E+17;negative;@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep.

5,70E+17;negative;@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!
5,70E+17;negative;@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
5,70E+17;positive;@united Ok thank again for your help!
5,70E+17;negative;@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
5,70E+17;neutral;Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
5,70E+17;positive;@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
5,70E+17;positive;"@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back."
5,70E+17;negative;@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
5,70E+17;negative;@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD

5,70E+17;negative;@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though.
5,70E+17;negative;@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.
5,70E+17;negative;@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
5,70E+17;negative;@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
5,70E+17;negative;@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not
5,70E+17;positive;@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?
5,70E+17;negative;@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
5,70E+17;positive;"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
5,70E+17;negative;@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
5,70E+17;negative;@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
5,70E+17;neutral;@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks.
5,70E+17;negative;@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
5,70E+17;negative;@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
5,70E+17;negative;@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!

5,70E+17;positive;"@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home."
5,70E+17;negative;@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
5,70E+17;negative;@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
5,70E+17;negative;@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
5,70E+17;negative;@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?

5,70E+17;negative;@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
5,70E+17;negative;@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
5,70E+17;negative;@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are
5,70E+17;negative;@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
5,70E+17;negative;@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense
5,70E+17;positive;@united ok thx!

5,70E+17;negative;@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Definitely will!
5,70E+17;negative;@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
5,70E+17;negative;@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
5,70E+17;positive;@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.

5,70E+17;negative;@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
5,70E+17;positive;@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
5,70E+17;negative;@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
5,70E+17;negative;@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse
5,70E+17;positive;@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
5,70E+17;neutral;@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?

5,70E+17;negative;@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
5,70E+17;negative;@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
5,70E+17;negative;@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
5,70E+17;neutral;@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
5,70E+17;negative;@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight

5,70E+17;positive;@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
5,70E+17;negative;@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people

5,70E+17;negative;@united already missed  connection ugh
5,70E+17;negative;@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft.

5,70E+17;negative;@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
5,70E+17;negative;@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
5,70E+17;negative;@united that's not even an apology

5,70E+17;negative;@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room
5,70E+17;negative;@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine.

5,70E+17;negative;"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
5,70E+17;negative;"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
5,70E+17;negative;@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.

5,70E+17;negative;@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool.

5,70E+17;negative;@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
5,70E+17;negative;@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
5,70E+17;negative;"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
5,70E+17;negative;@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United
5,70E+17;negative;@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
5,70E+17;neutral;@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty
5,70E+17;negative;@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
5,70E+17;negative;@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
5,70E+17;negative;@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
5,70E+17;negative;@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
5,70E+17;negative;@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx
5,70E+17;negative;@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
5,70E+17;negative;@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
5,70E+17;negative;@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded
5,70E+17;negative;@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
5,70E+17;negative;@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
5,70E+17;positive;@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
5,70E+17;negative;@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!"
5,70E+17;negative;@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
5,70E+17;positive;@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
5,70E+17;negative;@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
5,70E+17;negative;@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS
5,70E+17;negative;@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
5,70E+17;negative;@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
5,70E+17;negative;@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!
5,70E+17;negative;@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
5,70E+17;negative;@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
5,70E+17;negative;@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
5,70E+17;negative;@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away
5,70E+17;negative;@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
5,70E+17;negative;@united it will be on a different airline.
5,70E+17;negative;@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
5,70E+17;negative;"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
5,70E+17;negative;@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
5,70E+17;negative;@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
5,70E+17;neutral;@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
5,70E+17;negative;@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
5,70E+17;neutral;@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
5,70E+17;negative;@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
5,70E+17;negative;@united i need help but in spanish
5,70E+17;negative;@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
5,70E+17;negative;@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
5,70E+17;neutral;@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
5,70E+17;negative;@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
5,70E+17;negative;@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
5,70E+17;neutral;@united UA1469. Just landed.
5,70E+17;negative;@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
5,70E+17;neutral;@united flight 435
5,70E+17;negative;@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN
5,70E+17;negative;@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
5,70E+17;negative;@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
5,70E+17;positive;@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
5,70E+17;negative;@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA
5,70E+17;negative;@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
5,70E+17;negative;@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
5,70E+17;positive;@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
5,70E+17;negative;@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)
5,70E+17;negative;@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
5,70E+17;negative;@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
5,70E+17;negative;"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
5,70E+17;negative;@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
5,70E+17;negative;@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
5,70E+17;negative;@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
5,70E+17;negative;@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
5,70E+17;negative;@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
5,70E+17;negative;@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
5,70E+17;negative;@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?
5,70E+17;negative;@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
5,70E+17;positive;@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
5,70E+17;negative;@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
5,70E+17;negative;@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
5,70E+17;neutral;@united She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
5,70E+17;positive;@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
5,70E+17;negative;@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
5,70E+17;negative;@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
5,70E+17;positive;‚Äú@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z‚Äù
5,70E+17;negative;@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
5,70E+17;negative;@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
5,70E+17;positive;@united thank you!
5,70E+17;negative;@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
5,70E+17;negative;@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
5,70E+17;negative;@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
5,70E+17;negative;@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
5,70E+17;negative;@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
5,70E+17;negative;@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
5,70E+17;negative;@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
5,70E+17;positive;@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
5,70E+17;negative;@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
5,70E+17;positive;@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)
5,70E+17;negative;@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
5,70E+17;negative;@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
5,70E+17;negative;@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
5,70E+17;negative;@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
5,70E+17;negative;@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
5,70E+17;negative;@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
5,70E+17;negative;"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
5,70E+17;negative;@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
5,70E+17;negative;@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
5,70E+17;negative;@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
5,70E+17;negative;@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
5,70E+17;negative;@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
5,70E+17;negative;@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
5,70E+17;negative;@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
5,70E+17;negative;@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.
5,70E+17;neutral;@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
5,70E+17;neutral;@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need

5,70E+17;negative;@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
5,70E+17;negative;@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
5,70E+17;negative;"@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always"
5,70E+17;negative;@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
5,70E+17;negative;@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
5,70E+17;negative;@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
5,70E+17;negative;@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.
5,70E+17;positive;@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
5,70E+17;negative;@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
5,70E+17;negative;@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
5,70E+17;negative;@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
5,70E+17;negative;@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
5,70E+17;negative;@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
5,70E+17;negative;@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
5,70E+17;negative;@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
5,70E+17;negative;@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
5,70E+17;positive;@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!
5,70E+17;negative;@united lol too little too Late Flight
5,70E+17;negative;@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
5,70E+17;negative;@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
5,70E+17;negative;@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
5,70E+17;negative;@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief

5,70E+17;negative;@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s.

5,70E+17;negative;@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.

5,70E+17;negative;@united why do you hate your passengers?
5,70E+17;negative;@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
5,70E+17;negative;.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
5,70E+17;negative;@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
5,70E+17;negative;@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
5,70E+17;negative;@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
5,70E+17;negative;@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location

5,70E+17;negative;@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
5,70E+17;negative;@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
5,70E+17;positive;@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
5,70E+17;negative;@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
5,70E+17;negative;@united false.
5,70E+17;negative;@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
5,70E+17;positive;@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed.

5,70E+17;negative;@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight

5,70E+17;negative;@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
5,70E+17;negative;@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor.

5,70E+17;negative;@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
5,70E+17;negative;@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me

5,70E+17;negative;@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
5,70E+17;negative;@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?
5,70E+17;negative;@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?
5,70E+17;negative;@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
5,70E+17;negative;@united is by far the worst airline ever üò°üò°
5,70E+17;negative;@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
5,70E+17;negative;@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed

5,70E+17;negative;@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?

5,70E+17;negative;@united direct messages not going through please help
5,70E+17;neutral;@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures
5,70E+17;negative;@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
5,70E+17;negative;@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!

5,70E+17;negative;@united so what's the solution?
5,70E+17;negative;@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
5,70E+17;negative;@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
5,70E+17;negative;@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper

5,70E+17;negative;@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
5,70E+17;negative;@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2

5,70E+17;negative;@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!

5,70E+17;negative;@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.

5,69E+17;negative;".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
5,69E+17;negative;@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
5,69E+17;negative;@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,

5,69E+17;negative;@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.

5,69E+17;neutral;@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
5,69E+17;negative;@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
5,69E+17;negative;@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?

5,69E+17;negative;.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.

5,69E+17;negative;@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
5,69E+17;negative;@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!
5,69E+17;negative;@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
5,69E+17;negative;Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
5,69E+17;negative;@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.

5,69E+17;negative;@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
5,69E+17;negative;@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest

5,69E+17;negative;@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
5,69E+17;negative;@united sucks.
5,69E+17;negative;@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?

5,69E+17;negative;"@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed"
5,69E+17;negative;@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
5,69E+17;negative;@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.
5,69E+17;negative;@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
5,69E+17;positive;@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
5,69E+17;negative;@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212

5,69E+17;negative;@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
5,69E+17;negative;@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
5,69E+17;negative;@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
5,69E+17;negative;@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
5,69E+17;negative;@united no wheelchairs
5,69E+17;negative;@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
5,69E+17;negative;@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
5,69E+17;negative;@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround

5,69E+17;positive;@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!

5,69E+17;negative;@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
5,69E+17;negative;@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best
5,69E+17;negative;@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
5,69E+17;negative;@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual

5,69E+17;negative;@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
5,69E+17;negative;@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?

5,69E+17;negative;@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i‚Äôll come back.
5,69E+17;negative;@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
5,69E+17;positive;@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
5,69E+17;negative;@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn‚Äôt 1997!
5,69E+17;negative;@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo
5,69E+17;negative;@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
5,69E+17;negative;@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.
5,69E+17;negative;@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
5,69E+17;neutral;@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
5,69E+17;negative;@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
5,69E+17;negative;@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight

5,69E+17;negative;@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
5,69E+17;neutral;@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?

5,69E+17;neutral;@united Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm warning tomorrow already, what's up?
5,69E+17;neutral;@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
5,69E+17;negative;@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.
5,69E+17;negative;@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
5,69E+17;negative;@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
5,69E+17;negative;@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
5,69E+17;negative;@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated.

5,69E+17;negative;@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.

5,69E+17;neutral;@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond
5,69E+17;negative;@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
5,69E+17;negative;@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
5,69E+17;negative;@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
5,69E+17;negative;@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.
5,69E+17;negative;@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
5,69E+17;neutral;@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow

5,69E+17;neutral;@united Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm?
5,69E+17;negative;@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky

5,69E+17;negative;@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
5,69E+17;negative;@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
5,69E+17;negative;@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
5,69E+17;negative;@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
5,69E+17;negative;@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
5,69E+17;positive;@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
5,69E+17;negative;@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.

5,69E+17;negative;@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
5,69E+17;negative;@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
5,69E+17;negative;@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
5,69E+17;positive;@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
5,69E+17;neutral;@united anything yet JJ?

5,69E+17;negative;@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
5,69E+17;negative;@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
5,69E+17;negative;@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
5,69E+17;negative;@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
5,69E+17;negative;@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
5,69E+17;negative;@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
5,69E+17;positive;@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
5,69E+17;negative;@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
5,69E+17;negative;@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous

5,69E+17;neutral;@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
5,69E+17;negative;@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
5,69E+17;negative;@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact

5,68E+17;negative;"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
5,68E+17;negative;"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
5,68E+17;negative;@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
5,68E+17;neutral;@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
5,68E+17;neutral;@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!

5,68E+17;neutral;@United should find a way to distinguish boarding of premier members and credit card holders. Group 2 is too big!

5,68E+17;positive;"@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)"

5,68E+17;neutral;@united hi! I just bought a flight with united through ebokeers from Paris to Miami. Do I have any chance to check that everything is ok?
5,68E+17;neutral;@united no worries, I think it‚Äôs under control. (the emails are keeping me informed)
5,68E+17;negative;"@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed"
5,68E+17;neutral;@united ^JT is the ORD to PHL flight at 9:15 PM (CDT) delayed? DM I'm kinda hoping not to be stranded at ORD either.
5,68E+17;neutral;@united what happened to flight status map? It was so cool..
5,68E+17;negative;@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
5,68E+17;neutral;@united Hi guys. I submitted a request for ticket/hotel reimbursement for a delayed/over night stay coming back from the Dominican. Help?
5,68E+17;negative;@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.
5,68E+17;neutral;@united yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside?
5,68E+17;negative;@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
5,68E+17;negative;"@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?"
5,68E+17;positive;@united landing in anchorage, then on our way to fairbanks! http://t.co/FjkvQMbmaS

5,68E+17;negative;@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren‚Äôt going to improve my poor airport experiences.
5,68E+17;negative;@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
5,68E+17;positive;@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
5,68E+17;negative;@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä
